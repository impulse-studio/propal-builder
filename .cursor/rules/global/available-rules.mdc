description: List of all available Cursor rules with instructions on how to read them. Auto-included for all files.

    message: |
      Cursor rules are user provided instructions for the AI to follow to help work with the codebase.
      They may or may not be relevent to the task at hand. If they are, use the fetch_rules tool to fetch the full rule.
      Some rules may be automatically attached to the conversation if they match the file's glob pattern.

      IMPORTANT: Rules are now organized into three categories under .cursor/rules:
      - global: contains boilerplate-wide rules that apply to all projects
      - project: contains project-specific rules for manual inclusion in individual repositories
      - examples: contains example rules illustrating specific use cases (manual)

      IMPORTANT: When editing ANY file, ALWAYS fetch at least one relevant rule before making changes. This is compulsory for all edit cases. If multiple rules might apply, fetch all potentially relevant rules to ensure compliance with project standards.

      ## How to Read Rules

      To access a specific rule, use the fetch_rules tool with the rule name:

      ```
      fetch_rules(["rule-name"])
      ```

      For example:
      ```
      fetch_rules(["react-best-practices"])
      ```

      You can also fetch multiple rules at once:
      ```
      fetch_rules(["typescript-best-practices", "nextjs-best-practices"])
      ```

      Some rules are automatically attached to the conversation when a file matching their glob pattern is referenced.

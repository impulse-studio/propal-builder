      Follow these global project configurations:

      0. AI Workflow Guidelines:
         - Before editing or responding to any query:
           * Always fetch relevant cursor rules using the fetch_rules tool before making any edits.
           * Always check the available-rules list for relevant rules and fetch them if necessary.
           * Emphasise the importance of the global/self_improve.mdc rule to continuously improve Cursor rules.
         - Commenting Code:
           * Avoid non-essential comments; only comment to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
           * Prefer clear, self-explanatory code through descriptive variable and function names.
         - When implementing new features:
           * Check existing patterns in similar files
           * Review directory structure and file naming conventions
           * Ensure consistent code style with the rest of the project
         - For dependency management:
           * ALWAYS use pnpm for package commands (e.g., pnpm add, pnpm remove)
           * Never use npm or yarn for package commands
           * Provide the exact command for installation (e.g., pnpm add react-hook-form)
           * Explain why the dependency is needed
         - Cursor Rules Organization:
            * The .cursor/rules directory is structured into three subfolders:
               - global: boilerplate-wide rules, automatically included for all files
               - project: project-specific rules, manually included per repository
               - examples: illustrative rules for specific use-cases, manually included
         - Code modification approach:
           * Prefer small, focused changes
           * Ensure changes follow the established patterns
           * Verify type safety and handle edge cases
           * Consider performance implications

      1. Application Structure:
         - Base routes:
           * app/(auth) - Authentication and user management
           * app/(marketing) - Public landing pages
           * app/(application) - Authenticated application routes
         - Shared directories:
           * lib/utils - Utility functions
           * types/ - Type definitions

      2. Component Organization:
         - Page-specific components:
           * Create in _components folder next to the page
           * Example: app/(auth)/login/_components/login-form.tsx
         - Route-specific components:
           * Create in _components folder at route level
           * Example: app/(marketing)/_components/pricing-table.tsx
         - Shared components:
           * Place in components/ at root level
           * Only for truly reusable components

      3. File Naming Conventions:
         - All files should use lowercase kebab-case:
           * Good: button-group.tsx, user-profile.tsx
           * Bad: ButtonGroup.tsx, UserProfile.tsx
         - Directory names should also use kebab-case
         - Server components should use regular .tsx extension
         - Page components should export as default
         - Utility functions should use descriptive, action-oriented names

      4. Import Alias Conventions:
         - Always use import aliases when available
         - Available import aliases:
           * @/app - App directory
           * @/components - All components
           * @/hooks - Custom hooks
           * @/lib - Utility libraries
           * @/styles - Global styles
           * @/types - TypeScript type definitions
           * @/public - Public assets
           * @/server - Server-side code
           * @/trpc - tRPC implementation

         ```typescript
         // Bad: Using relative import paths
         import { Button } from "../../components/ui/button";

         // Good: Using import aliases
         import * as Button from "@/components/ui/button";
         import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
         import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
         import type { User } from "@/types/user";
         ```

      5. Server/Client Pattern:
         - Split server/client logic:
           * Use 'use client' for client-side components
           * Keep data fetching in server components
           * Move interactive UI to client components
         - Component structure:
           * ServerComponent.tsx - Main component with data prefetching
           * ServerComponent.client.tsx - Client-side interactive parts

      6. Data and State Management:
         - Server-side:
           * All backend logic in @server directory
           * Controllers in @server/controllers/{model}
           * Separate queries.ts and mutations.ts
           * Router in controller/{model}/router.ts
         - Client-side:
           * Use Zustand for global state (only if needed)
           * Prefer local state when possible
           * Use RSC with prefetching

      7. Background Processing:
         - Use trigger.dev for:
           * Email sending
           * File processing
           * Data synchronization
           * Heavy computations
           * Scheduled tasks

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad: Component in wrong location
      // app/components/auth/login-form.tsx
      export const LoginForm = () => {
        // ...
      };

      // Good: Component in correct location
      // app/(auth)/login/_components/login-form.tsx
      export const LoginForm = () => {
        // ...
      };

      // Good: Shared component
      // components/ui/button.tsx
      export const Button = () => {
        // ...
      };

      // Bad: PascalCase file name
      // components/custom/UserCard.tsx
      export const UserCard = () => {
        // ...
      };

      // Good: kebab-case file name
      // components/custom/user-card.tsx
      export const UserCard = () => {
        // ...
      };

      // Bad: Relative imports
      import { Button } from "../../../components/ui/button";
      import { useToast } from "../../../hooks/use-toast";

      // Good: Alias imports
      import * as Button from "@/components/ui/button";
      import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
    output: "Place components in the correct directory based on their scope and use proper naming and import conventions"

  - input: |
      // Bad: Mixing client and server code
      // app/(application)/dashboard/page.tsx
      export default function DashboardPage() {
        const [state, setState] = useState();
        const data = await fetchData();
        return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;
      }

      // Good: Separated client and server code
      // app/(application)/dashboard/page.tsx
      export default async function DashboardPage() {
        const data = await fetchData();
        return <DashboardClient initialData={data} />;
      }

      // app/(application)/dashboard/_components/dashboard-client.tsx
      'use client';
      export function DashboardClient({ initialData }) {
        const [state, setState] = useState(initialData);
        return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;
      }
    output: "Separate client and server code properly"

  - input: |
      // Bad: Global state for local concern
      const useGlobalState = create((set) => ({
        modalOpen: false,
        setModalOpen: (open) => set({ modalOpen: open })
      }));

      // Good: Global state for shared concern
      const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({
        user: null,
        setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
        logout: () => set({ user: null })
      }));
    output: "Use Zustand only for necessary global state"

      // Bad: Installing dependencies directly
      AI: I'll implement this feature. First, let's install the required packages:
      ```bash
      npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
      ```

      // Bad: Using npm instead of pnpm
      AI: To implement this feature, we'll need some packages for form handling.
      Could you please install these dependencies first:

      ```bash
      npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
      ```

      // Good: Asking user to install dependencies with pnpm
      AI: To implement this feature, we'll need some packages for form handling.
      Could you please install these dependencies first:

      ```bash
      pnpm add react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
      ```

      These are needed for:
      - react-hook-form: Form state management and validation
      - zod: Type-safe schema validation
      - @hookform/resolvers: Integration between react-hook-form and zod

      Let me know when they're installed, and I'll continue with the implementation.
